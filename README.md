> #### Known Bugs and posible version updates:
>
> - I know that the project is incomplete or with bugs, this is only my fault but I have some ideas to improve it.
> - Fix the buttons functionalities and complete all the interfaces, giving them access to the api data.
> - fix and organize the files of the project and split the styles in a document per page structure.
> - improve the design of the frontend and give more time to develop a responsive mobile based website.
> - add the pull request section to the main project user flow, I already designed those sections but i didn't have time to improve it more.
> - add a couple of automated test in order to ensure the functionality of the website (I don't have a lot of experience in automated tests)
